                        <p><b>HELLTENDER</b> is a 3D bartending narrative game where you serve cocktails, blackmail patrons, and find meaning in a world purpose built for your torture. You're Dana, a washed-up twenty-something who's just died and fallen straight into Hell, and not even the good part.</p>
    
                        <p>Within Hell, on its first circle, is a city of broken dreams and hopeless nights. Trash and lost items from earth fall from the sky. Humans orchestrate the mass torture of the lower circles as the backbone of the economy. Demons rise from the lower circles and haphazardly lay waste to any unfortunate enough to cross their path. And annunal purges eradiacate millions of souls; left not for dead, but a fate worse than death...</p>

                        <p><b><em>But this isn't a story about Hell...</em></b></p>
    
                        <p>It's about the broken people trapped in it, and the ones who might still find hope.</p>
    
                        <p>Maybe one of them is you.</p>

                        <p>Your boss has employed you posthumously to work at her bar and assist her in collecting gossip and secrets from the hell dwellers to ultimately blackmail the demon elite and rule hell itself.</p>
    
                        <p>And the doors to her bar, the <em>The Ninth Circle</em> have swung wide, inviting all those who are willing to drink their problems away, at your service. <b><em>There's no telling who will wander in seeking to drown their afterlife sorrows in booze.</em></b></p>

                            The game is still very much in development. It hasn't even been announced yet. :P Cocktails haven't been finalised yet, don't have a composer and still working on the demo. But by joining the discord you'll be the first to learn about updates, and receive the demo when its done! You'll also be able to shape development and various decisions!

                            There is no way to support us currently. We could throw up a donation button on here but we are hoping to run a kickstarter and some point in the future, so we wouldn't want to risk undermining momentum on that. The most you can do is join the discord and be active, or just lurk. Either way you'll keep up to date with the game when I ping everyone every so often. Cheaper than a mailing list!
