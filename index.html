                    <p>Our team... is non existent! It's just me! A solo dev, making this game :P. I am currently studying Computer Science at Exeter University, and since it's my dream to become a successful indie game developer, I figured it was about time I released a game. </p>
                    <p> I started making games since I was a wee-little 14 year old. They are all crap, understandably. But nowadays, I seem to be able to make slightly less crap games ;P. In all seriousness, it's pretty surreal seeing myself today. If I told myself back then that I would be making a website for one of my games, I would have probably had a heart attack, because time travel is not a normal daily oocurence and my weak 14 year old heart probably couldn't take that.</p>
                    <p> I've been working on this game for about a year now, and I'm really excited to finally release it! I hope you enjoy it! If you want to support any of my future games, follow me on twitter! I still don't get how it works but we can figure that out later...</p>
